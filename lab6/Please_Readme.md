# Lab 6For this one put your solutions into a the following files:+ lab6q1.png and lab6q1.blend+ lab6q2.png and lab6q2.blend+ lab6q2.mkv and lab6q3.blendVersion:
Q1: useing blender2.91
Q2&Q3 : useing blender 2.79
Reason:At first I used the newest blender to finish Q1, 
however when I was doing Q2&Q3, I met some problems with version2.91
So I changed back the version to 2.79 and finished the Q2&Q3
Problems:
when tried to open Q1 with 2.79, you may met problem, so maybe using 2.91 to open it
