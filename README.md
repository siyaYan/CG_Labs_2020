# Labs 2020

This is the start point for the Computer Graphics labs for 2020.

Basically each lab is in a different directory.  For the most part the labs just 
involve recording some labs notes as you conduct the lab. This should be in markdown
and placed in the labXnotes.md files within the lab directory. For some labs you can also add source code into the directory.
